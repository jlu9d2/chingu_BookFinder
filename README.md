# Chingu Project

A book finding app that uses the google books API and searches based on book title and author



## Acknowledgements

_I used the google books API for this book search project

_I used margin and padding alot to align the elements but I think I could have used a different, more efficient method. For the sake of saving time I went with what I was most comfortable

_I took about 10 hours create this app in one day.

_I did my best using classes for the CSS

_I could have refactored my CSS code to make it less DRY
